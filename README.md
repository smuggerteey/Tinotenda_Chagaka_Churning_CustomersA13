Customer Churn Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn, which is the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a business. By using historical customer data and machine learning techniques, we can build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn. This enables the business to take proactive measures to retain those customers and improve customer retention rates.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains customer information such as demographics, usage patterns, and churn status. It includes the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
SubscriptionType: Type of subscription (e.g., monthly, yearly).
TotalCharges: Total charges incurred by the customer.
ServiceUsage: Usage of various services provided by the business.
Churn: Churn status (1 if churned, 0 if retained).
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

Copy
cd customer-churn-prediction
```

Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

basic
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the churn prediction script:

Copy
python churn_prediction.py
```
Model Training and Evaluation
The churn prediction model is trained using a supervised machine learning algorithm. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. Several evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are computed to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting churn.

Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test set, indicating its ability to correctly predict customer churn. However, further analysis is required to identify patterns and factors that contribute to churn and to develop targeted strategies for customer retention.

Future Enhancements
Here are some potential areas for future enhancements:

Feature engineering: Explore additional customer features or derive new features that may improve prediction accuracy.
Model optimization: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms or hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the model's performance.
Real-time prediction: Develop a system that can make churn predictions in real-time based on streaming customer data.
Interpretability: Use techniques like feature importance analysis or SHAP values to understand the factors driving customer churn.
